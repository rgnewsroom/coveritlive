#### Setup your CoveritLive event

* Create new CoverItLive event, turn social sharing off:

* Complete first page and click “Next Step >>”.
* Input a custom URL into the ”Location / URL” field; typically, this URL should be an RG-branded [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) link, e.g.: <http://rgne.ws/UOvsMSU>
* Scroll down to “Embed Code“ section and turn “ON”:
	* “100% Width” option.
	* “Infinite Height”
* Click the blue “Save Event” button.

* On the “My Upcoming Events" page, click the “Prep Mode” button for the event you just created.
* Click on the “Social Automate” icon (on the upper-right side) and add in `rgsports/lists/football-updates`. This will bring everyone in the [@rgsports](https://twitter.com/rgsports/) [“Football updates” list](https://twitter.com/rgsports/lists/football-updates) into the “SmartStream” center column.
* Click on the “Scoreboard” icon (on the upper-right side) and sort through options to add the upcoming game you’ll be covering.
* Next, find pre-game coverage (i.e., tweets from the sports staff) via the search icon in the top-right corner. Once found, click the plus icon that appears when hovering over tweet. This should be a maximum of 5 tweets, consisting of the stories in today’s newspaper.

#### Setup your WordPress post

* Login to WordPress …

#### NOT FINISHED YET:

* Follow those links and embed the tweets into a new WordPress post that follows the same styles as a previous post. Make sure you add plenty of tags such as:
  * `oregon, ducks, football, live, updates, news, visiting-team, eugene, register, guard` 
* Add in the game-day info above the embedded tweets. Make sure that the info is styled correctly, see previous posts such as MSU or Wyoming.
* Let it sit, adding in pertinent stories as needed.
* Go back to CoverItLive.

* Add additional users if needed, ie: interns, etc.
* Go down to scoreboard and add that for the current game.

### Game day

* Start aggregating other pre game social media and try making some of your own via prep mode.
* When you have about ten posts or so launch the event and embed it in the post. Wipe the other embeds out of the post.
* Continue adding content throughout and respond to the comments as necessary. 
* Update the publish time on the post and the headline with each score/quarter change.
* Finish off by thanking fans and by linking to story recap and teasing other stories.
* End the event, this should be within an hour of the game ending since these are "live updates". It's nice to finish off with a link to the recap story.
