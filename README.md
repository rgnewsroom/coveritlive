* Enter prep mode for the event, collect some recent social media goodness from the sports staff
* Follow those links and embed the tweets into a new WordPress post that follows the same styles as a previous post. Make sure you add plenty of tags such as:
  * `oregon, ducks, football, live, updates, news, visiting-team, eugene, register, guard` 
* Add in the game-day info above the embedded tweets. Make sure that the info is styled correctly, see previous posts such as MSU or Wyoming.
* Let it sit, adding in pertinent stories as needed.
* Go back to CoverItLive.
* Click on `Social Automate` on right side and add in `rgsports/lists/football-updates`. This will bring everyone in the rgsports football updates list into the SmartStream in the center.

## Game day

* Start aggregating other pre game social media and try making some of your own via prep mode.
* When you have about ten posts or so launch the event and embed it in the post. Wipe the other embeds out of the post.
* Continue adding content throughout and respond to the comments as necessary. 
* Update the publish time on the post and the headline with each score/quarter change.
* Finish off by thanking fans and by linking to story recap and teasing other stories.
* End the event, this should be within an hour of the game ending since these are "live updates". It's nice to finish off with a link to the recap story.
